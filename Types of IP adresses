An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique string of numbers separated by periods (IPv4) or colons (IPv6) that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.

Types of IP addresses:Types of IP addresses:
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):

Format: Four sets of numbers (each between 0 and 255), separated by periods.
Example: 192.168.1.1
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):

Format: Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.
Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
An IP address in bits refers to how the address is represented and structured in binary (0s and 1s), as IP addresses are fundamentally a series of binary numbers.

IPv4 in Bits:
An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits and is divided into four 8-bit sections, each called an "octet." These octets are often represented in decimal form, but they are actually binary under the hood.

For example, the IPv4 address 192.168.1.1 in binary is:

192 = 11000000
168 = 10101000
1 = 00000001
1 = 00000001
So, the full binary representation of 192.168.1.1 is:

11000000 10101000 00000001 00000001

In total, this address is 32 bits long (4 groups of 8 bits).

IPv6 in Bits:
An IPv6 address consists of 128 bits and is represented as eight groups of 16-bit hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons. IPv6 uses a much larger address space than IPv4, allowing for a vastly higher number of unique addresses.

For example, the IPv6 address 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 in binary is:

2001 = 0010000000000001
0db8 = 0000110110111000
85a3 = 1000010110100011
0000 = 0000000000000000
0000 = 0000000000000000
8a2e = 1000101000101110
0370 = 0000001101110000
7334 = 0111001100110100
So, the full binary representation would be 128 bits long.

Why Bits Matter:
IPv4 (32 bits): Can provide around 4.3 billion unique addresses (2^32).
IPv6 (128 bits): Can provide an astronomically larger number of addresses (2^128), which equals approximately 340 undecillion addresses.
Each bit in an IP address represents a place value in binary, just like digits in a decimal number, but the base is 2 (0 or 1) rather than 10. This binary format is used by computers and networking hardware to handle routing and communication
